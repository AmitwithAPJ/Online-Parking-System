# Online Vehicle Recognition System

A web-based system that utilizes machine learning for automatic vehicle recognition. The system captures vehicle images, processes them through a pre-trained model, and identifies vehicles based on their make, model, and license plate. The application includes both front-end and back-end components, as well as machine learning for image processing and vehicle recognition.

## Features

- **Vehicle Recognition**: Identifies vehicles from images using machine learning models.
- **User Authentication**: User registration and login system.
- **Real-time Recognition**: Processes and returns recognition results in real-time.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin users can view vehicle records and recognition events.
- **Image Upload**: Allows users to upload images for vehicle recognition.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express)
- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV
- **Database**: MySQL (or PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
